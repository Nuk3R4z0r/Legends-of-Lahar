# Legends-of-Lahar
Text-based RPG with turn-based combat.


A recreational project, doing it to improve my programming skills and because I believe it would be somewhat fun to play.
You're free to join in on the fun.

The final product is to include:

Creating a character (Always hardcore).

The character can gain levels, spells, attributes and special talents.

The character use various moves in a text-based, turn-based combat.

The character can get gear, gold and xp as reward.

Unique talent tree with high-end talents like “Can't be stunned” or “The enemy can't see how hurt you are”.

Click on an area to find combat or events through random exploring.

The ability to find hidden areas, maybe areas that you can't easily got out of.

Events can turn out to be good or bad for the character.

Events can grant unique loot/spells, titles, eventually modifications coming with the titles as “Demon Lord” makes the character a demon and gives stats, maybe spells that only the demon lord can use.

Multiplayer against other players. (Either hosted server, to avoid p2p security problems or connect to IP)

Trading with other players.




The original project was TheLostFortune, but due to inactivity by the other developers I started up my own repository.
